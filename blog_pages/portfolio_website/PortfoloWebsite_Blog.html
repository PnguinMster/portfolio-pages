            Take a look behind the scenes and learn more about my thought process and thoughts going through my head.
            While creating my portfolio website.

            This image is of the concept and stuff. This is mostly filler words to make it seem like it would seem in
            the actual final look outline thing. From the start to the end. slowly over the next steps and other stuff.
            switching between coding, design and other stuff.

            Hopefully i remember other stuff. when i do write the blog or page for this one. not only this one but also
            the rest and other pages. I wonder what else stuff there will be. as well as other types of words and stuff.
            you know. I hope this is long enough. so this should be roughly the solution, i mean conclusion. sorry i got
            distracted.

            Guess I lied, it turns out i needed more things to write. it just looked better and have me a better idea
            with three pictures. probably add other stuff like subheadings for each section. as well as other stuff like
            folds to make it easier to slide between sections. Possibly also adding them to the side of the website for
            different sections of the website and blog page. i should also look at other website to see and some
            inspiration. that is long enough, good enough. right? yeah, good enough.
